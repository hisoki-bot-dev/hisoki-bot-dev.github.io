        <passage>(4)So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran. (5)He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there. (6)Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At the time the Canaanites were in the land. (7)The LORD appeared to Arbam and said, 'To your offspring I will give this land.' So he built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him. (8)From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD. (9)Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev. (10)Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe. (11)As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, 'I know what a beautiful woman you are. (12)When the Egyptians see you, they will say, "This is his wife." Then they will kill me but will let you live. (13)Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.' (14)When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman. (15)And when Pharaoh's officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace. (16)He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels. (17)But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram's wife Sarai. (18)So Pharaoh summoned Abram. 'What have you done to me?' he said. 'Why didn't you tell me she was you wife? (19)Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!' (20)Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.</passage>
